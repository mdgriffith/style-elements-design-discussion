# Welcome to the Style Elements Design Discussion!

I've been trying out a number of different experimental things to improve the [style-elements](https://github.com/mdgriffith/style-elements) library, but then it hit me..._why not get the feedback from the crazy awesome elm people I know_?


This repo is dedicated to discussing a few things about the [style-elements](https://github.com/mdgriffith/style-elements) library:

  * __What is intuitive behavior?__ - There are many corners of weird behavior in the defaults of CSS.  We want this library to have a well thought out approach to each of them.  This is usually a surprisingly hard question.
  * __Discussion/exploration of new features__ 
  * __Discussion of approaches used by other libraries or references__

This discussion mainly happens through issues.  Comments welcome, even if it's just a thumbs up or down!

## Why a new repo?

Issues on the _main_ style elements repo are used for one thing, _bugs_.  Essentially I want it to be a repository for "I was trying to do this and then something was unexpected".  We can then reference and discuss here if necessary.

I think this separation makes sense so there's not a lot of noise between people experimenting/discussing and people needing a solution.  However, it's also an experiment!  It may change later if this turns out to be silly.
