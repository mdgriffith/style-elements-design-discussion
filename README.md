# Welcome to the Style Elements Design Discussion!

I've been trying out a number of different experimental things to improve the [style-elements](https://github.com/mdgriffith/style-elements) library, but then it hit me..._why not get the feedback from the crazy awesome elm people I know_?

Comments welcome, even if it's just a thumbs up or down!

## Additional Features:

  * [Embedding `elm-style-animation`s directly in your stylesheet](https://github.com/mdgriffith/style-elements-design-discussion/issues/7)
    * I think this could be crazy useful for managing animation heavy sites


## Organization

Standardizing some organization of CSS would be awesome.

  * [Grouping style properties by category](https://github.com/mdgriffith/style-elements-design-discussion/issues/9)
  * [`style`, `position`, and `layout` categorized classes](https://github.com/mdgriffith/style-elements-design-discussion/issues/10)
        * Style classes that can only have one category of props.

## Experimental

Brian Hicks, lord of the elm-benchmark, organizer of elm-confs, and giver of the highest of fives mentioned checking out [constraint based stylesheets alá cassowary](http://gridstylesheets.org/guides/ccss/).  This is pretty cool and warrants some thought.

  * [Style via Constraints](https://github.com/mdgriffith/style-elements-design-discussion/issues/11)

# Less Exciting Stuff

## Bad property elimination or handling.

  * [Eliminating certain properties](https://github.com/mdgriffith/style-elements-design-discussion/issues/1)
  * [Handling of error prone props](https://github.com/mdgriffith/style-elements-design-discussion/issues/2)
  * [Limiting allowed units and why](https://github.com/mdgriffith/style-elements-design-discussion/issues/3)

## Improved Interfaces

  * [Layout - Flexbox ++ Grid Layout](https://github.com/mdgriffith/style-elements-design-discussion/issues/4)
  * [CSS Animation](https://github.com/mdgriffith/style-elements-design-discussion/issues/5)
  * [Media Queries](https://github.com/mdgriffith/style-elements-design-discussion/issues/6)

## Potential Modularity
  
  * [Style scoping](https://github.com/mdgriffith/style-elements-design-discussion/issues/8)
